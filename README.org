* julia-staticlint

This repository is a fork of dmalyuta/julia-staticlint which is no
longer supported, with minimal changes made to support newer versions
of StaticLint and SymbolServer.

This simple package provides static code linting of Julia ~julia-mode~ language
buffers through the [[https://github.com/julia-vscode/StaticLint.jl][StaticLint.jl]] backend. The static linting is done by a
background process, which sends errors over a TCP connection to Flycheck for
display in the Emacs buffer. The result looks like this:

#+HTML: <p align="center"><img src="./demo.png" /></p>

This code was tested with the following setup:

- OS: Manjaro Linux, kernel 5.1.19
- Emacs: 28.2
- Julia: 1.9.2
  - StaticLint: v8.1.0
  - SymbolServer: v7.2.1

In order to make this code run for your Emacs setup, include the following in
your ~init.el~ (using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] and [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa]]):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package julia-staticlint
    ;; https://github.com/dmalyuta/julia-staticlint
    ;; Emacs Flycheck support for StaticLint.jl
    :ensure nil
    :quelpa ((julia-staticlint :fetcher github
                   :repo "eRedekopp/julia-staticlint"
                   :files (:defaults "julia_staticlint_server.jl"
                         "julia_staticlint_client.jl")))
    :hook ((julia-mode . julia-staticlint-activate))
    :config
    (julia-staticlint-init))
#+end_src

Because this code uses a Julia backend, make sure that you can open a Julia
REPL using the command ~julia~ in your terminal. You should also have the
following packages installed in Julia: ~StaticLint~, ~SymbolServer~, ~Printf~,
and ~Sockets~. Install by entering the following sequence into the Julia REPL:

#+begin_src julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add(["SymbolServer","StaticLint","Printf","Sockets"])
#+end_src
